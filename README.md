Paper available at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.14.20231894v1

Scripts to generate and evaluate disease phenotypes from EHRs using embeddings based on Word2vec, GloVe or Fasttext and distance analysis. We release phenotypes derived during the study for all ICD-9 codes (top 100 closest concepts in the embeddings space).

Requirement:

* Python 2.7
* scikit-learn
* gensim
* numpy
* glove
* scipy
